            </h1>
            <p>Zakat is the third pillar of Islam. It requires Muslims to give 2.5% of their qualifying wealth
                each
                year to
                help Muslims who need it across a range of categories. Zakat is both a spiritual duty and a

                part
                of
                the Islamic social welfare system.
            </p> <br> <br>
            <p> Zakat is more than just a payment or a random act of charity. It’s a unique form of religious
                social welfare which benefits the whole community.</p> <button class="btn2" id="btn">Explore

            <p>“Zakat is payable on gold only”</p>
            <p>No, zakat is payable on cash, gold, silver, pension funds, stocks, shares, property on <br> rent and any
                money owed to you. If a married woman owns her own gold amounting <br> to above the nisab value, she is
                liable to pay zakat on this. It is entirely up to her <br> husband should he wish to pay this on her
                behalf.
            </p> <br>
            <p>Remember, zakat is due on a Muslim’s total wealth as opposed to primarily the excess <br> wealth. Always
                check the current nisab rates prior to paying zakat.</p>

                <p>Zakat is a religious obligation, ordering all Muslims who meet the necessary criteria to donate a
                    certain
                    portion of wealth each year to charitable causes.

                <p>Zakat is said to purify yearly earnings that are over and above what is required to provide the
                    essential needs of a person or family.

                <p>Zakat is based on income and the value of possessions. The common minimum amount for those who
                    qualify is 2.5%, or 1/40 of a Muslim's total savings and wealth.
